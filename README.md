# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Project

This project demonstrates how I deployed a static website using Amazon S3.

## Project Summary

The goal was to host a static website on AWS by uploading a simple HTML file to an S3 bucket and configuring the bucket for public access and web hosting. This was part of my learning journey with AWS services and cloud deployment.

## What I Did

- Created an S3 bucket named practiselcaws
- Enabled static website hosting on the bucket
- Uploaded a sample index.html file
- Configured the bucket policy to allow public access
- Verified that the site is accessible from a browser
